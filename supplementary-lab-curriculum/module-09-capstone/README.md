# Module 9: Capstone Project

> Part of the COSC-502 Self-Directed Lab Curriculum (generated by Claude, an AI assistant by Anthropic)

## Learning Objectives

- Integrate all learned concepts
- Design and implement a complete system
- Document and present technical work

## Choose Your Project

Select one of the three options below:

---

## Option A: Complete 8-bit CPU in Logisim
**Location:** `option-a-cpu-design/`

Design a fully functional 8-bit CPU

**Requirements:**
1. At least 8 instructions (arithmetic, logic, memory, control flow)
2. 4+ general-purpose registers
3. Working ALU with flags
4. Program counter and branch support
5. Memory interface (RAM and ROM)
6. Basic I/O capability

**Deliverables:**
- Complete Logisim circuit
- ISA specification document
- Sample programs with expected outputs
- 10-15 page technical report (in `report/`)

---

## Option B: Assembly Language Project
**Location:** `option-b-assembly-project/`

Implement a significant program in x86 assembly

**Suggested Projects:**
1. **Text Editor:** Simple line-based text editor with file I/O
2. **Game:** Text-based game (hangman, number guessing, simple maze)
3. **Encryption Tool:** Implement AES or simpler cipher
4. **Image Processor:** Basic operations on BMP files
5. **Compression:** Implement RLE or simple LZ compression

**Deliverables:**
- Fully commented assembly source code
- README with build and usage instructions
- Test cases and expected outputs
- 10-15 page technical report (in `report/`)

---

## Option C: Hardware/Software Co-Design
**Location:** `option-c-codesign/`

Design CPU in Logisim with custom assembler

**Requirements:**
1. Design simple CPU in Logisim
2. Define instruction set architecture
3. Write assembler in Python/C to convert assembly to machine code
4. Write sample programs in your assembly language

**Deliverables:**
- Logisim CPU circuit
- Assembler source code
- ISA documentation
- Sample programs
- 15-20 page technical report (in `report/`)

---

## Report Guidelines
**Location:** `report/`

Your technical report should include:

1. **Introduction** - Problem statement and objectives
2. **Background** - Relevant theory and concepts
3. **Design** - Architecture decisions and rationale
4. **Implementation** - How you built it
5. **Testing** - Test cases and results
6. **Challenges** - Problems encountered and solutions
7. **Conclusion** - Summary and future work
8. **References** - Sources cited
