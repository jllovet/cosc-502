# Module 7: Advanced x86 and Optimization

> Part of the COSC-502 Self-Directed Lab Curriculum (generated by Claude, an AI assistant by Anthropic)

## Learning Objectives

- Understand instruction pipelining and hazards
- Learn SIMD instructions (SSE/AVX)
- Analyze and optimize assembly code

## Labs

### Assembly Lab 7.1: SIMD Programming
**Location:** `labs/assembly/`

Use SSE/AVX for parallel computation

**Tasks:**
1. Add two arrays of floats using SSE
2. Implement dot product using SIMD
3. Compare performance with scalar version
4. Explore memory alignment requirements

**Deliverable:** SIMD-optimized programs with benchmarks

### Assembly Lab 7.2: Inline Assembly in C
**Location:** `labs/assembly/`

Mix C and assembly for optimization

**Tasks:**
1. Write inline assembly using GCC extended asm
2. Optimize a critical loop using inline assembly
3. Use compiler intrinsics for SIMD
4. Analyze compiler output with -S flag

**Deliverable:** C programs with inline assembly optimization

### Assembly Lab 7.3: Reverse Engineering Basics
**Location:** `labs/assembly/`

Analyze compiled binaries

**Tasks:**
1. Compile C programs and analyze generated assembly
2. Use objdump and readelf to examine binaries
3. Identify functions, loops, and data structures in assembly
4. Modify a binary's behavior (simple crackme)

**Deliverable:** Analysis report with annotated disassembly

## Paper Assignment
**Location:** `papers/`

### Paper 7: Modern CPU Optimization Techniques
Write a 5-6 page paper on modern CPU optimization including: instruction pipelining, branch prediction, out-of-order execution, speculative execution, and the security implications (Spectre/Meltdown).
