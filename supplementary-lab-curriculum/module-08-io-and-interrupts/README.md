# Module 8: Input/Output and Interrupts

> Part of the COSC-502 Self-Directed Lab Curriculum (generated by Claude, an AI assistant by Anthropic)

## Learning Objectives

- Understand memory-mapped I/O and port-mapped I/O
- Learn interrupt handling mechanisms
- Interface with hardware at the assembly level

## Labs

### Logisim Lab 8.1: Memory-Mapped I/O
**Location:** `labs/logisim/`

Add I/O devices to your CPU from Module 4

**Tasks:**
1. Implement address decoding for I/O region
2. Add a memory-mapped LED display
3. Add memory-mapped switches for input
4. Write programs that use I/O devices

**Deliverable:** CPU with I/O capabilities

### TinkerCAD Lab 8.2: Serial Communication
**Location:** `labs/tinkercad/`

Build a simple UART transmitter

**Tasks:**
1. Understand RS-232 serial protocol
2. Build shift register for serial output
3. Implement start/stop bits
4. Transmit ASCII characters serially

**Deliverable:** Working UART circuit with documentation

### Assembly Lab 8.3: System Calls and OS Interaction
**Location:** `labs/assembly/`

Deep dive into Linux system calls

**Tasks:**
1. Implement file I/O using syscalls (open, read, write, close)
2. Create a simple file copy program
3. Use mmap for memory-mapped file access
4. Explore /proc filesystem from assembly

**Deliverable:** Assembly programs demonstrating various syscalls

## Paper Assignment
**Location:** `papers/`

### Paper 8: The Role of Interrupts in Modern Computing
Write a 4-5 page paper on interrupt-driven I/O. Explain polling vs. interrupts, interrupt priority, interrupt controllers (APIC), and how modern operating systems handle interrupts.
