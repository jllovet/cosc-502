# Module 3: Sequential Logic Circuits

> Part of the COSC-502 Self-Directed Lab Curriculum (generated by Claude, an AI assistant by Anthropic)

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the difference between combinational and sequential logic
- Build flip-flops and latches
- Design counters and registers

## Labs

### TinkerCAD Lab 3.1: SR Latch and D Flip-Flop
**Location:** `labs/tinkercad/`

Build memory elements from basic gates

**Tasks:**
1. Construct an SR latch using NOR gates
2. Build a gated SR latch (with enable)
3. Convert to a D flip-flop
4. Test and document state transitions

**Deliverable:** Working circuits with timing diagrams

### Logisim Lab 3.2: 4-bit Register File
**Location:** `labs/logisim/`

Design a register file with read/write capabilities

**Tasks:**
1. Build a single 4-bit register using D flip-flops
2. Create a 4-register file (R0-R3)
3. Implement 2-bit address decoding for read/write
4. Add dual read ports (read two registers simultaneously)

**Deliverable:** Register file circuit with usage documentation

### Logisim Lab 3.3: Binary Counter with Display
**Location:** `labs/logisim/`

Build a synchronous 4-bit counter

**Tasks:**
1. Design a 4-bit up counter
2. Add down-counting capability
3. Implement load and reset functions
4. Connect to 7-segment display from Module 2

**Deliverable:** Complete counter circuit with control documentation

## Paper Assignment
**Location:** `papers/`

### Paper 3: Memory Hierarchy in Modern Computers
Write a 4-5 page paper on memory hierarchy, covering registers, cache (L1, L2, L3), RAM, and storage. Explain why hierarchy exists and discuss concepts like locality of reference, cache hits/misses, and memory bandwidth.
