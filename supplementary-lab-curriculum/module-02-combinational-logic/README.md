# Module 2: Combinational Logic Circuits

> Part of the COSC-502 Self-Directed Lab Curriculum (generated by Claude, an AI assistant by Anthropic)

## Learning Objectives

- Design and build multiplexers and demultiplexers
- Construct arithmetic circuits (adders, subtractors)
- Implement decoders and encoders

## Labs

### TinkerCAD Lab 2.1: Building a 4-bit Adder
**Location:** `labs/tinkercad/`

Construct a ripple-carry adder from basic gates

**Tasks:**
1. Build a half adder circuit
2. Build a full adder circuit
3. Chain four full adders to create a 4-bit adder
4. Test with various 4-bit binary inputs

**Deliverable:** Working circuit with test documentation

### Logisim Lab 2.2: ALU Design (Part 1)
**Location:** `labs/logisim/`

Design an 8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit

**Tasks:**
1. Implement addition and subtraction operations
2. Add AND, OR, XOR logical operations
3. Create operation selector using multiplexers
4. Add zero and overflow flags

**Deliverable:** Logisim ALU circuit with operation documentation

### Logisim Lab 2.3: 7-Segment Display Decoder
**Location:** `labs/logisim/`

Build a BCD to 7-segment display decoder

**Tasks:**
1. Create truth table for all segments (a-g)
2. Derive Boolean expressions for each segment
3. Implement in Logisim with a 7-segment display component
4. Test all decimal digits (0-9)

**Deliverable:** Working decoder circuit with K-map simplifications shown

## Paper Assignment
**Location:** `papers/`

### Paper 2: Karnaugh Maps and Circuit Optimization
Write a 3-4 page paper explaining Karnaugh maps as a method for Boolean function simplification. Include worked examples showing how K-maps reduce gate count in practical circuits.
