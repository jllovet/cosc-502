# Module 6: x86 Memory and Stack

> Part of the COSC-502 Self-Directed Lab Curriculum (generated by Claude, an AI assistant by Anthropic)

## Learning Objectives

- Understand memory segmentation and addressing modes
- Master stack operations and calling conventions
- Write functions with proper stack frames

## Labs

### Assembly Lab 6.1: Memory Addressing Modes
**Location:** `labs/assembly/`

Explore x86 addressing modes

**Tasks:**
1. Direct addressing: access fixed memory locations
2. Register indirect: [rax], [rbx + 4]
3. Base + index: [rbx + rsi*4]
4. Implement array traversal using each mode

**Deliverable:** Documented examples of each addressing mode

### Assembly Lab 6.2: Stack Operations
**Location:** `labs/assembly/`

Master the stack

**Tasks:**
1. PUSH and POP operations with visualization
2. Implement a stack-based expression evaluator
3. Write recursive factorial function
4. Analyze stack growth using GDB

**Deliverable:** Stack-based programs with memory diagrams

### Assembly Lab 6.3: Functions and Calling Conventions
**Location:** `labs/assembly/`

Write proper x86-64 functions

**Tasks:**
1. Implement System V AMD64 ABI calling convention
2. Write a function with local variables (stack frame)
3. Call C library functions from assembly
4. Call your assembly functions from C

**Deliverable:** Mixed C/assembly programs demonstrating interoperability

## Paper Assignment
**Location:** `papers/`

### Paper 6: Stack-Based Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities
Write a 4-5 page paper explaining stack-based buffer overflows. Discuss how they work at the assembly level, historical exploits (Morris Worm, Code Red), and modern mitigations (ASLR, stack canaries, DEP/NX bit).
