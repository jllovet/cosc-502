# Module 4: Computer Architecture Fundamentals

> Part of the COSC-502 Self-Directed Lab Curriculum (generated by Claude, an AI assistant by Anthropic)

## Learning Objectives

- Understand von Neumann architecture
- Learn instruction set architecture concepts
- Explore the fetch-decode-execute cycle

## Labs

### Logisim Lab 4.1: Simple Instruction Decoder
**Location:** `labs/logisim/`

Build an instruction decoder for a simplified ISA

**Tasks:**
1. Define a simple 8-bit instruction format (3-bit opcode, 5-bit operand)
2. Design decoder logic for 8 instructions (ADD, SUB, LOAD, STORE, JUMP, etc.)
3. Generate control signals based on opcode
4. Test with sample instruction sequences

**Deliverable:** Decoder circuit with ISA documentation

### Logisim Lab 4.2: Program Counter and Control Unit
**Location:** `labs/logisim/`

Design control logic for sequential execution

**Tasks:**
1. Build a program counter with increment and load
2. Implement branch/jump logic
3. Create a simple state machine for fetch-decode-execute
4. Connect to instruction decoder from Lab 4.1

**Deliverable:** Control unit with state diagram documentation

### Logisim Lab 4.3: Complete Simple CPU
**Location:** `labs/logisim/`

Assemble a working (simplified) CPU

**Tasks:**
1. Integrate ALU from Module 2
2. Connect register file from Module 3
3. Add instruction memory (ROM)
4. Wire control unit and data paths
5. Execute a simple program (e.g., add two numbers)

**Deliverable:** Working CPU simulation with test programs

## Paper Assignment
**Location:** `papers/`

### Paper 4: RISC vs. CISC Architectures
Write a 4-5 page paper comparing RISC and CISC instruction set architectures. Discuss historical development (focusing on x86 as CISC and ARM as RISC), design trade-offs, and modern hybrid approaches.
